    <h2>About Cookie Co.</h2>
    <h5>From the students of Technological University of the Philippines section BSIT-2AB, comes our own take on localized online bakeshops – Cookie Co. <br><br>
      Enlivened by a whimsical passion project, out little online bakeshop started making craftsman bread and naturally prepared desserts. Also, upon a little achievement, our peers started to approach us for orders made with that fluffy pastry, trailed by savory flavors, and servings of fresh cakes, and even custom-made orders. <br><br>
      Our visitors’ solicitations kept on moving us as our bread shop’s menu and business developed. <br><br>
      Today, we keep on satisfying the palates and desires of our customers with a menu of fixing enlivened, arranged to arrange the taste close to home. When you visit our shop, you’ll see genuine effort in baking the goods since we care a lot about our customers. You’ll feel the love of our members, the freshness of the products, and our burning desire to deliver your needs.<br><br>
      All our recipes were developed with the utmost care as these were made with our families in mind. We look forward to baking for you and your family!
